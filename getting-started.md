#Getting Started

###Installing Node

The simplest way to install node is from [nodejs.org][nodejs.org].

You can also install node via a [system package manager][node-via-package-manager].

For the adventurous you can use a version manager designed just for node such as [nvm][nvm] or [n][n].

###What do I do now?

This really depends on how comfortable you feel.  

If you have never done javascript before you might want to first check out [javaScript For Cats][for-cats].

If you are comfortable with js but have never played with node you can't go wrong with checking out [node school][node-school].
